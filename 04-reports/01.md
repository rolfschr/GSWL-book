# Reports #

Having a journal is all nice and fine but we actually only keep it to gain some insights on our financial situation.
This is where reports fly in.
A report displays the journal in some meaningful way.
Ledger is able to report in a great variety of ways which makes it extremely powerful.
The most standard commands for reporting are ``balance`` and ``register``.

## Balance reports ##

The balance report is quite intuitive.
It creates a total balance from all transactions.
The basic command is:

~~~{.bash}
$ ledger -f file.txt bal[ance]
# or, in our case
$ led bal # alias defined by ecosystem/alias
~~~

The output is something like:

~~~{.diff}
        $2145.00  Assets:Checking
       $-1000.00  Equity:OpeningBalances
         $192.00  Expenses
          $65.00    Food:Groceries
         $127.00    Unknown
       $-1337.00  Income:Salary
 ---------------
               0
~~~

Normally, you want to have a more precise balance by putting some restrictions on the account name, the time or whatever:

~~~{.bash}
# Restrict by date.
$ led (--period|-p) "last 6 months" bal
$ led -p "2042" bal

# Restrict by account name.
$ led bal ^Expenses

# Restrict by account names.
$ led bal ^Expe and not Groceries

# Show all assets in the same currency (this assumes a prices database for conversion, see below).
led bal --exchange $ ^Assets

# Do not show sub accounts.
led --depth 2 bal
led --depth 3 bal # Note how the totals do not change.

# Do not indent accounts.
led --flat bal
~~~

## Register reports ##

Register reports display the journal like an old-fashioned register.
The example command line arguments as above apply, of course.

~~~{.bash}
# Show the register report.
$ led reg
# (The second last column gives the actual amount, the last column the running sum.)

# Restrict time span.
$ led -p "2041" reg Assets

# Show the running average.
$ led reg -A Restaurant
# (Ignore the "<Adjustment> lines". The 2nd column gives the running average.)

# Group by month.
$ led reg -M Food

# Collapse transactions with multiple postings into one.
$ led reg -M -n Expenses # compare against 'led reg -M Expenses'

~~~

## Advanced Report Filtering ##

Reported information (balance or register) can be filtered in a more sophisticated way.
This is achieved by either ``--limit`` (``-l``) or ``--display`` (``-d``).
The difference between both is that the first limits the postings to be considered for calculations whereas the latter limits the postings to be considered for display.
This means that the arguments ("expression") used in conjunction with ``--limit`` is active while Ledger goes through the journal file.
On the other hand, the expressions supplied to ``--display`` will only filter the final result *after* having read the journal completely.

As an example, consider one wants to get an overview of the usual amount spent every month.
That is, we're interested in the average monthly expenses over the last x months.
This can be easily achieved by ``led -M -n -A -p "from 2041/11/01" register ^Expenses``.
Go try it out in the private repo.
The resulting report will report each month's total expenses starting from November 2041 and calculate the running average (last column).
Now, to get back to our filtering:
Imagine you're only interested in the average of all months combined.
This information is only available after having taken into account the last month obviously.
However, all previous monthly expenses are needed to calculate it.
This is where the difference of ``--limit`` & ``--display`` can be easily seen:

~~~{.bash}
# Show monthly expenses & average since Nov 2041
$ led -M -n -A --limit "date>=[2041/11/01]" reg ^Expenses
~~~

vs

~~~{.bash}
# Show monthly expenses since Nov 2011 & average monthly expense since the dawn of time
$ led -M -n -A --display "date>=[2041/11/01]" reg ^Expenses
~~~

See how the last the value of the last column in the first row is different to the first command.
This comes from the fact that there is journal data from before 2041/11/01 which is taken into account for the average calculation when only restricting with ``--display``.

Combining both:

~~~{.bash}
# Show monthly expenses for Mar 2042 & average monthly expenses since Nov 2011
$ led -M -n -A --limit "date>=[2041/11/01]" --display "date>=[2042/03/01]" reg ^Expenses
~~~

See how the average column changes?
That's exactly the difference between filtering before calculation ("limit") or before presenting results ("display").

As another example, consider the following journal:

~~~{.commonlisp}
2042/01/15 * Random stuff 1
    ; Earn $100, spend $50 and keep the rest at the bank.
    Income                                  $-100
    Expenses                                $50
    Bank                                    $50

2042/01/25 * Random stuff 2
    ; Spend $150 taking the remaining $50 plus a $100 loan.
    Expenses                                $150
    Bank                                    $-150
~~~

Here, someone lives way beyond her means.
This person only earned $100 but spent $200.
The bank apparently gave a $100 loan:

~~~{.bash}
$ led bal
               $-100  Bank
                $200  Expenses
               $-100  Income
--------------------
                   0
$ led reg
42-01-15 Random stuff 1         Income                        $-100        $-100
                                Expenses                        $50         $-50
                                Bank                            $50            0
42-01-25 Random stuff 2         Expenses                       $150         $150
                                Bank                          $-150            0
~~~

Let's say we want to have a look at all accounts which have a positive balance.
The expressions employed would be ``amount > 0``.
However, depending on whether ``--limit`` or ``--display`` is used, the outcome is quite different:


~~~{.bash}
$ ledger bal -d 'amount > 0'
                $200  Expenses
$ led bal -l 'amount > 0' # limit postings for calculation
                 $50  Bank
                $200  Expenses
--------------------
                $250
~~~

The output of ``--display`` seems quite intuitive.
At the end of the day, the Expenses account has a balance of $200 whereas the others are negative.
Using ``--limit`` only considers the postings ("lines") with a positive amount:
For the first transaction, that means $50 in the Expenses account and $50 in the Bank account, for the second transaction we have another $150 in the Expenses account.
Hence we end up with a total of $250.

Most of the time, ``--display`` is what you want.
In fact, the result of ``--limit`` & ``--display`` are often the same.
Not always though:

~~~{.bash}
# Show the total amount of $ ever sent to the bank account (only possible with -l).
$ led bal -l 'account =~ /Assets:Checking/ and amount > 0' 

# Get the amount of $ spent for books at RandomShop (-d is fine here, too).
$ led bal -l 'account =~ /Expenses:Books/ and payee =~ /RandomShop/' 

# List all expenses higher than $100.
$ led reg  Expenses -l 'amount > 100'
~~~

Try to get the following information using the private repo [additional question in brackets].
The answers are found on the next page.

(1) How much money was spent on groceries [since Jan 1st 2042]?
(2) How much money was spent for rent & electricity?
(3) How much money was spent in total each month [on average]?

### Answers ###

(1) How much money was spent on groceries [since Jan 1st 2042]?

~~~{.bash}
led bal Groceries
# or
led bal -l 'account =~ /Groceries/'
# With date restriction:
led bal Groceries -p "since 2042/01/01"
# or
led bal -l 'account =~ /Groceries/ and date >= [2042/01/01]'
~~~

(2) How much money was spent for rent & electricity?

~~~{.bash}
led bal Expenses:Rent Electr
# or
led bal -l 'account =~ /Expenses:Rent|Electr/'
~~~

(3) How much money was spent each month [on average]?

~~~{.bash}
led reg -n -M [-A] Expenses
# or
led reg -n -M [-A] -l 'account =~ /^Expen/
~~~

(4) Which income was "earned" that is not salary?

~~~{.bash}
led reg Income and not Salary
# or
led reg -l 'account =~ /Income/ and account !~ /Salary/'
~~~

(5) How much money was spent on gifts (account name) on Amazon (payee name)?

This can only be solved by ``--limit``:

~~~{.bash}
led bal -l 'account =~ /Gifts/ and payee =~ /AMAZON/'
~~~

Looking at the answers, one realizes that the ``--limit`` switch often looks cumbersome.
Still, in some situations, you may have to resort to the more powerful expressions.

## Recurring Reports ## {#Recurring_Reports}

Most of the time, you're interested in the "usual suspects".
I personally have 5-10 reports, which I always want to check after updating the journal.
Obviously it's a waste of time to type them in by hand.
One way to simplify things would be to define (probably cryptic) aliases for each of these reports.
Another way is to use the ``reports.py`` script provided in the ecosystem repo.
The script opens the file ``reports.txt`` in the current working directory and displays predefined reports one by one.
The text file is expected to contain empty-line-separated sections consisting of comments (starting with ``#``) and actual commands to execute.
You may invoke the whole thing with the ``ledreports`` command (this is actually done automatically in the tmux session's "overview" window).
The ``reports.txt`` in the current working directory may look like this:

~~~{.bash}
# Each paragraph consists of explanations ('# ...') and the cmd itself (last line).
# The first section is the header.

# Show the current journal status.
led bal

# Show all transactions involving Food, then show transactions involving Transportation.
led reg Food
led reg Transportation

# Show expenses in percentage & sort by amount.
led bal --percent --sort "(total)" --depth 2 Expenses
~~~

The ``reports.py`` script will show the above sections as 3 distinct pages each with one or more reports.
You may cycle through the listed reports using ``j`` and ``k``.
In the terminal window, each report is prefixed by the comment and the actual command to help you understand what's going on.
Note that the script sources the ``alias`` file from the ecosystem in the current working directory in order to allow the usual commands.
Remember that the ``alias`` file itself tries to source the file ``alias.local`` in the current working directory which allows you to easily append your own stuff.

Try out ``ledreports`` in the private repo:

~~~{.bash}
$ sl # "start ledger" as defined the .bashrc
$ ledreports
~~~

## Other Reports ##

You want to try out these:

~~~{.bash}
$ led stats
$ led accounts
$ led payees
$ led print
$ led xml
~~~

## Visualization ##

Ledger comes with two handy switches (``-j/-J``) to allow to feed it's output to gnuplot (or other tools) to visualize the data.
The register report can be modified to only output the date and either the current the amount (``-j``) or the running total (``-J``).

~~~{.bash}
# Output monthly expenses
$ led reg -n --monthly -j Expenses
2041-09-01 509
2041-10-01 484
2041-11-01 955.49
2041-12-01 809.49
2042-01-01 455.5
2042-02-01 285.5
2042-03-01 882.47
# Output cumulative monthly expenses
$ led reg -n --monthly -J Expenses
2041-09-01 509
2041-10-01 993
2041-11-01 1948.49
2041-12-01 2757.98
2042-01-01 3213.48
2042-02-01 3498.98
2042-03-01 4381.45
~~~

The ``ecosystem/alias`` defines the function ``ledplot`` which wraps around gnuplot to visualize some data:

~~~{.bash}
ledplot -j -M -n reg Expenses # assuming gnuplot is installed
~~~

Some of the sample reports do have a couple of predefined plots you can checkout.
See ``private/reports.txt`` for more.
